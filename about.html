<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Once again, I am redefining myself and following my 
passion for technology toward a career as a developer.
To fully understand the path that I am now on, a view into
my history is needed.  Please read on to learn more about
who I am becoming based on what I have done in the past.
</p>
  
<h2>Researcher</h2>
</p>
I spent over a decade managing and performing experiments, 
collecting and analyzing data, and sharing my findings with
the vision sciences community.  I worked on a variety of 
projects aimed at rehabilitating patients with vision 
deficits as well as basic research on how the human visual 
system works.  
</p>
  
<h2>Adjunct Professor</h2>
<p>
<em>Docendo discimus</em> is latin for "by teaching, we learn" 
(Seneca the Younger, circa 4 BC – 65 AD).  I found this to be
true after when I worked as an adjunct professor for 5 years.
I developed curriculum, lectured, assessed student learning; 
but, most of all I gained a deeper understanding of the topics 
I taught.
</p>

<h2>Homeschool Instructor</h2>
<p>
Had it not been for teaching at the college level, I would 
probably not have trusted my teaching skills enough to become
a homeschool mom.  I was concerned about not being able
to provide the same level of instruction that a middle school 
child would be exposed to at a traditional school with a vast 
number subject matter experts and resources.  Retrospect being
20/20, I had nothing to fear:  I found I had a natural
aptitude for explaining complex concepts in plain terms
and a gift for igniting the fire to learn.
</p>

<h2>Private Tutor</h2>
<p>
Starting my private tutoring business has been a way for me
to pass forward the knowledge I have acquired over the years.
I get a particular satisfaction from bringing a student who
struggles in some area to a level of mastery where they are 
comfortable and excited to learn more.   
</p>

<h2>Becoming a Student Again</h2>
<p>
Everyone who I have taught to date has heard me at one time 
or other explain that learning has less to do with natural
aptitude and more to do with the willingness to spend the 
time necessary to aquire new knowledge and skills.  It isn't 
enough to believe in what you say, but to live it.  This is
precisely why I have gone back to school to learn Computer 
Science.  I know that given enough time, I will become a 
subject matter expert in whatever academic silo I aim my 
career at next.
