<h1>Securing the Operating System</h1>
<p>
The Operating System virtualizes memory, not only to 
make processes run efficiently, but also to keep 
potentially dangerous processes from disrupting other 
processes or even taking over the system  
(Arpaci-Dusseau & Arpaci-Dusseau, 2012).  Considering 
the extent to which devices are networked, &quot;it is no 
surprise that developers have implemented a variety of 
defensive countermeasures to halt those wily hackers 
from gaining control of systems&quot; (Arpaci-Dusseau & 
Arpaci-Dusseau, 2012).  One method to thwart hacking, 
is to monitor systems and networks for malicious activity 
and benign events that could leave systems vulnerable 
to attack (NSA/CSS ,2013).  In other words, logging 
system activity for proactively monitoring the custom 
views of the logs on a daily basis or plugging the logs 
into a Security Information Event Management (SIEM) 
system can help an administrator determine if a system 
is at risk or if it has already been compromised so that 
action can be taken to rectify the situation.  
According to the NSA/CSS (2013), the first step in 
logging system activity should be to deploy a clean, 
and therefore uncorrupted, dedicated server whose sole 
use it is to collect and archive log data from both 
itself and the network machines it is monitoring.  In 
addition to a machine which collects log data, all of 
the &quot;source&quot; machines being monitored will have to 
periodically send pertinent logs that they create to the 
&quot;collector&quot; machine. Moreover, the transmission of logs 
should be encrypted as well as follow an assortment of 
authentication policies to &quot;Harden&quot; the collection of 
event logs against malicious activity (NSA/CSS, 2013). 
Windows OS already has built-in features that allow for 
the logging of events and for their transmission to a 
collector device; and by isolating important logs on an 
otherwise unused collector machine, the risks of those 
logs being erased to hide nefarious activity is reduced 
and the benefits of logging as a way to detect 
vulnerabilities can be achieved (NSA/CSS, 2013).
