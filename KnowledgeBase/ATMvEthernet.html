<h1>Ethernet vs Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</h1>
<p>There is an ever increasing volume of data 
communication across networks.  In order to 
accommodate higher levels of network traffic, 
the search for better network technologies has 
ensued.  This essay will compare Ethernet with 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) across several 
criteria:  bandwidth, scalability, 
interoperability, and quality of service.  By 
comparing these technologies on these dimensions,
organizations can determine whether to adopt one 
technology over the other. 
</p>

<h2>Bandwidth</h2>
<p>
A consideration for comparing Ethernet to ATM is 
bandwidth.  The basic transfer rate of Ethernet is 
10 Mbps.  However, with greater bandwidth needs, 
Ethernet has been extended over the years to carry 
100 Mbps.  In fact, with the advent of Gigabit 
Ethernet, it is able to transport 1000 Mbps of data.  
ATM was proposed in 1988 to replace Ethernet.  At the 
time, Ethernet&apos;s transfer rate of 10 Mbps was quickly 
becoming obsolesced by the ever increasing demands for 
broadband technology.  ATM&apos;s basic transfer rates 
were more than double that of Ethernet, at 25 Mbps.  
Moreover, ATM also offered 155 and 622 Mbps data rates.  
However, timely upgrades to Ethernet, have far 
surpassed the rate of data transfer of ATM.  Gibabit 
Ethernet is nearly double the transmission rate provided 
by ATM at 622 MBPS.  The difference between these two 
transfer rates closes further if one considers that packet 
headers take up more bandwidth when using ATM than when 
using Ethernet.  Not surprisingly, Ethernet comprises 
80% of all local area network (LAN) installations, making 
it the most popular LAN technology today (Mickelsson, 1999).  
</p>

<h2>Scalability</h2>
<p>
Whether a technology can scale to meet networking needs 
is another consideration when comparing Ethernet to ATM.  
Ethernet was originally just a LAN technology, whereas 
ATM can be used to transmit information across LANs, MANs 
(metropolitan area networks), and WANs (wide area networks).  
ATM was specifically developed to span all three levels 
of network with the same protocol, completely eliminating 
the need for gateways and routers.  However, this has not 
materialized.  Although ATM has proven to be useful in the 
WAN space, Ethernet has grown into MAN environments and is 
even being considered for use over WANs (Mickelsson, 1999).
</p>

<h2>Interoperability</h2>
<p>
Another comparison point between Ethernet and ATM is 
interoperability.  The different versions of Ethernet work 
well together, with Gigabit Ethernet being based on the 
original Ethernet technology.  In this way, LANs that have 
been using Ethernet technology can continue to do so while 
the larger networks are upgraded to Gigabit Ethernet.  This 
is not the case for ATM (Mickelsson, 1999).  Since many 
networking applications have been build for traditional LANs,
which use Ethernet, applications would have to be changed 
to accommodate ATM.  Alternatively, LAN Emulation applications 
(or LANE) would need to be used in order to allow LAN networks 
to remain intact while using ATM.  This, however, eliminates 
any sophisticated features that ATM offers.
</p>

<h2>Quality of Service</h2>
<p>
Ethernet and ATM can also be compared on their quality of 
service.  ATM&apos;s major strength is an established standard 
for quality of service.  ATM offers for levels of service: 
Constant Bit Rate, Variable Bit Rate, Unspecified Bit Rate, 
and Available Bit Rate (Mickelsson, 1999).  Unfortunately, 
because of the lack of standardization in other aspects of 
the network, the quality of service can deviate from the 
standards which were established.  Moreover, not all networks 
support all service levels offered by ATM.  As for Ethernet, 
there are no explicit standards for quality of service, 
perhaps due to Ethernet LANs having traditionally provided 
enough bandwidth to obviate the need for quality of service 
standards.  Another issue with Ethernet LANs adopting some 
standards of quality of service is that they would be dependant 
on WAN service, which is mostly uses ATM.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The competition between Ethernet and ATM continues.  Ethernet 
continues to dominate LANs and ATM is firmly rooted in WANs.  
Giving consideration to bandwidth, scalability, interoperability, 
and quality of service will be increasingly important as network
needs become more demanding. Migrating from one technology to 
the other would be a huge undertaking and investment which 
should only be done after comparing these two data communication 
technologies thoroughly.
