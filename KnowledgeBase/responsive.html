<h1>What is Responsive Design?</h1>
<p>
Responsive Design means that web pages are created to look 
good on any device, including large desktop monitors, laptops, 
tablets, and small-screened smartphones (Pilon, 2018; &quot;HTML 
Responsive Web Design&quot;, 2018).  Traditional web pages may 
display correctly on a large monitor, but on smaller devices 
a user may need to scroll horizontally in order to see all of 
the content.  Websites that are graphics heavy might be slow 
to load and very large images might &quot;break&quot; the layout on 
smaller devices. With a responsive design approach, a web 
page has HTML elements and CSS styles which will automatically 
respond differently when viewed on devices of different sizes, 
so content is readable and easy to navigate.
</p>

<img src="/KnowledgeBase/responsive.jpg" width="*" height="*" alt="Responsive Design Graphic">

<p>
One way to illustrate responsive design is to compare it directly 
with a traditional website and Deque Systems has done just this 
as part of their Web Accessibility curriculum.  
<a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-non-responsive">
This link</a> will take you to a traditional &quot;fixed&quot; web site.
To simulate what this would look like on a tablet or smartphone, 
squish your browser horizontally, so that content to the right 
is being cut off and you would need to scroll right to see it.
To see the same website with a responsive design, click 
<a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-responsive">
this link</a>. 
Once again, squish your browser width or view it in a phone or 
tablet and you should notice that the layout changes and the 
image becomes narrower.  
As part of their curriculum, they provide the code for the 
responsive web page, which you can find 
<a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-source-responsive">
here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am choosing just a few examples of code from their source that 
are notable.
</p>


<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="10">
    <tr>
	<td style = "width:30%">The viewport is the same as the device width.  
            This makes it so that content will not run off 
            the right side of the browser window.</td>
	<td style = "width:70%">&#60;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&#62;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td>Images will only ever be as wide as the browser 
            window and they will retain the same aspect ratio.</td>
	<td>img {max-width:100%; height:auto;} </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td>Different nav links were created for desktops, tablets, and phones
            Notice that tablet has a single word per list item to make the nav bar narrower.</td>
	<td>
  		&#60;li class="desktop"&#62;&#60;a href="#"&#62;Learn about Accessibility&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62; <br>
  		&#60;li class="desktop"&#62;&#60;a href="#"&#62; Testing Tools&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62; <br>
  		&#133; <br>
  		&#60;li class="tablet"&#62;&#60;a href="#"&#62;Learn &#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62; <br>
  		&#60;li class="tablet"&#62;va href="#"&#62;Tools&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62; <br>
 		&#133; <br>
  		&#60;li class="phone"&#62;&#60;a href="#"&#62;Learn about Accessibility&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62; <br>
  		&#60;li class="phone"&#62;&#60;a href="#"&#62;Testing Tools&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62; <br>
		&#133; <br>   </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td>When a phone is detected the nav menu is stacked instead of horizontal.</td>
	<td>nav li.phone {display:block;}

	</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Why is the mobile web the most important element of web design?</h2>
<p>
More and more people are viewing web pages on mobile devices. &quot;A recent 
Pew study 77 % of Americans now own smartphones in 2018 which is up 
from just 35% in Pew Research Center&apos;s first smartphone ownership 
survey carried out in 2011.&quot;  More importantly, mobile traffic on 
websites is growing.  Infact, website traffic via mobile devices is 
on the rise, whereas the total percentage of traffic from desktops 
in declining (Enge, April 27, 2018).
</p>

<p>
Not only do web traffic trends support the idea that mobile web is 
the most important element of web design, but website developers also 
need to be mindful of the fact that Google announced the mobile-first 
index, which will rank websites based optimization for mobile devices. 
&quot;If your website does not have a responsive layout, has a slow loading 
speed or poorly designed navigation and content, your ranking is likely 
to decrease if you don&apos;t optimize your site for mobile before the shift&quot; 
(Marse, Apr 10, 2018).
