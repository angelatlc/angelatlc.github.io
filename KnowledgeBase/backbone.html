<h1>Cyber Attacks and the Internet Backbone</h1>
<p>


<p>It is common knowledge that the library at Alexandria was 
burned to the ground, destroying untold amounts of accumulated 
human knowledge.  I often wonder what knowledge civilization 
had that was wiped out in that fire (astronomy, structural 
engineering for pyramids and obelisks, complicated mathematics 
done on baboon leg bones that mimics binary, etc.).  
</p>

<p>Once again, we have amassed immense knowledge from around 
the world through the internet.  This time, I hope, the internet 
will prove to be more robust than the library at Alexandria was.  
And while I think that not all information can be completely 
wiped out, I also believe that <em>functionally</em> it can seem so 
to some peoples.  So this is an immensely important topic.
</p>

<p>There is a very comprehensive article about the internet 
backbone (Lee, 2014) and I summarize its relevant points here:
</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Conceptually, the internet backbone is the connectivity 
	between computer networks that allows high-speed communication 
	and information sharing across the globe.  More tangibly, it is 
	the physical cables and cell towers that make all of this 
	connectivity possible.  
	</li>

	<li>At least in terms of the United States, the backbone might 
	be considered the various ISP networks which span across the 
	country.  When you think globally though, the backbone might 
	be the cables running across oceans and borders of countries, 
	connecting a country to the internet at large.
	</li>

	<li>These tangible aspects of the internet backbone can be 
	damaged and therefore prone to attacks.  However, the United 
	States has &quot;dozens of links to the outside world, making a 
	coordinated shutdown of the US internet almost impossible&quot; 
	(Lee, 2014).  Unfortunately, physical backbone disruption 
	could affect countries with fewer links out (as was the case 
	when India and Egypt lost connectivity in 2008), or with 
	several links in the hands of the few (as was the case when 
	the Egyptian government cut off outside internets access 
	during protests in 2011).
	</li>
 	</ul>

<p>For countries not well linked to the greater internet, 
I would think that cyber attacks would be aimed at taking 
out the links connecting them to other countries.  For well 
connected countries, like the U.S., I am not sure there is a 
way to completely disrupt the internet backbone.  And 
frankly, I think this is why cyber attacks in the US are 
against individual companies, like getting user data from 
some financial institution.  Nevertheless, the cyber security 
of other countries is important for the US because we have a 
global economy and if one part of the world experiences a 
loss, soon we all will.
