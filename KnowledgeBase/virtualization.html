<h1>Virtualization and Virtual Machines</h1>
<p>Virtualization can mean somewhat different things 
depending on the technology going virtual.  In some 
cases virtualization can mean that &quot;the operating system 
takes a physical resource (such as the processor, or 
memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a more 
general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form of 
itself [...called...] a virtual machine (VM).&quot; 
(Arpaci-Dusseau & Arpaci-Dusseau, 2012).  In this 
context, the operating system is allowing multiple 
programs (as well as the OS itself) to share the 
device&apos;s resources.  In this way, a user can have 
several programs and apps running at the same time.  
However, this is not the only way to use virtualization 
and it is certainly not the most pertinent.
</p>

<p>Virtualization can mean &quot;technology 
that is used to split physical machine hardware resource 
for running multiple operating systems in one machine&quot; 
(Rajalakshmi, Srinandhini, & Uma, 2015).  For example, 
a computer running Windows OS can also host a virtual 
machine, or an emulation of a computer system, running 
Linux OS or any other OS for that matter.  In this way, 
multiple operating systems can be on a single device and 
share its hardware resources.  This may not seem like a 
drastic difference from what other definitions of virtualization, 
considering emulation software is just another program.  
However, being able to run virtual machines with different 
operating systems and system configurations on the same 
hardware has many advantages.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the uses of virtual machines (Rajalakshmi, 
Srinandhini, & Uma, 2015):
	<ul>
	<li>One use for virtual machines is to test software and 
	debug it before deploying it at the enterprise level.  
	Using a single device, with numerous virtual machines each 
	running different operating systems and configurations, a 
	developer can test and debug a program on multiple platforms.  
	This is an efficient and cost effective method to test 
	software before deployment.
	</li>

	<li>Another use for virtual machines is as a backup of the 
	virtual machine&apos;s state at any particular time.  This enables 
	a &quot;snapshot&quot; of an exact point in time to be stored and then 
	restored later. Not only is this useful as a backup in case 
	a machine gets corrupted, but it can be used as a method for 
	version control as updates and features are added to the machine.
	</li>

	<li>Multiple virtual machines simulating individual client 
	desktops, each with different data, applications, and operating 
	system can be run on a single physical host server.  Centralizing 
	computing in this way allows IT departments to reduce hardware 
	costs  and set up new desktops quickly since users would access 
	their virtual desktops from inexpensive (or shared) client machines. 
	</li> 
	</ul>
</p>

<p>All this said, virtualization is not a panacea:  there 
can be disadvantages.  When something does go wrong with a 
virtualized system, expertise in troubleshooting 
virtualization problems will be necessary.  Moreover, when 
a physical failure happens, then all machines (both physical 
and virtual) need to be restored, which can be devastating.
