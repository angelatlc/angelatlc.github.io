<h1>Virtualizing the CPU</h1>
<p>How does an operating 
system virtualizes the CPU, thereby creating the illusion 
of multiple CPUs?  An important point to make before 
delving into how virtualizing the CPU is accomplished 
needs to be that hardware devices can have more than one 
physical CPU (Arpaci-Dusseau & Arpaci-Dusseau, 2012).  
For the sake of discussion, however, let us limit the 
discussion to hardware devices with only one physical CPU 
to be virtualized.  With this in mind, the point of this 
writing is to describe how the OS can multitask several 
processes (running programs) seemingly at once.
</p>
<p>Operating systems feign running several processes on 
the CPU at once through a technique called Time Sharing, 
which amounts to &quot;&#133;running one process, then stopping 
it and running another, and so forth&#133;&quot; (Arpaci-Dusseau & 
Arpaci-Dusseau, 2012).  Through time-managed sharing, 
multiple processes can use the CPU and other device 
resources, with the only downfall being that the speed 
and performance of individual processes necessarily 
decreases as more and more processes vie for the use of 
the CPU.  
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most practical question regarding 
virtualizing the CPU is determining how the OS decides 
which process among many will access system resources at 
any given point in time, based on the process state that 
the processes are in.  According to Arpaci-Dusseau & 
Arpaci-Dusseau (2012), the processes can transition between 
the following states:  running, ready, and blocked.  In 
addition, this context switch is determined by a scheduling 
policy based on a variety of factors (including performance 
metrics, workload knowledge, and historical information) 
to make this decision.  
</p>
<p>There are different algorithms that an operating 
system can use to schedule processes while multitasking 
programs (Negi & Kalra, 2014).  The 
point of experimenting with different scheduling policies 
is to make the most efficient use of the CPU by reducing 
&quot;waiting time, turnaround time, response time and context 
switch of processes&quot; (Negi & Kalra, 2014).  According to 
this same article, most operating systems use the &quot;Round 
Robin&quot; scheduling policy for CPU time sharing.  This policy 
will go through the various processes cyclically, giving 
them each a fixed amount of time to run and then switching 
to the next one in the cycle, with the just performed process 
going to the bottom of the ready list.  Apparently, the 
Round Robin algorithm can be made more efficient, by coming 
up with better and better algorithms to determining how long 
each process should have access to the CPU before switching 
to the next process.  Round Robin is already more efficient 
than other policies like First Come First Serve or Smallest 
Job First, but it can be improved further by optimizing the 
amount of time each process has access to the CPU in the 
Round Robin (Negi & Kalra, 2014).
