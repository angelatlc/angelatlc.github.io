<h1>About PHP</h1>

<h2>The Most Popular Server Programming Language</h2>
<p>
In order to have empirical evidence for which server programming 
language is the most popular, a web technology survey report 
that gets updated daily can be viewed at W3Techs.com.  At the 
time of this writing, their survey report showing that over 80% 
of websites use PHP and that this market share percentage has 
been fairly consistent over the past 12 months, indicating that 
PHP is neither increasing nor declining in popularity.  The other 
interesting part of the graph is that the next runner up is 
ASP.NET at well under 20% and the others are below 1% of market 
share.  Many other programming languages were also part of the 
survey, but if they scored under 0.1% market share, they were 
not even shown on the graph.  So, it is safe to say that PHP is 
the most popular server programming language at the time of this 
writing. (&quot;Historical trends in the usage of server-side 
programming languages for websites&quot;, August 3, 2018).  
</p>

<h2>A list of websites that use PHP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Facebook.com</li>
<li>Wikipedia.org</li>
<li>Qq.com</li>
<li>Vk.com</li>
<li>Sina.com.cn</li>
<li>360.cn</li>
<li>Csdn.net</li>
<li>Wordpress.com</li>
<li>Deloton.com</li>
<li>Pinterest.com</li>
(Excerpted from &quot;Usage statistics and market share of PHP for websites&quot;, August 3, 2018).)
</ul>

<p>
Moreover, it is easy to tell if a web page is using php, 
as the url will often have a file with a .php ending.
</p>

<h2>Most web pages today require server side programming</h2>
<p>
&quot;An increasingly common trend in web design is for all content 
on a website to be stored in a database&quot; (&quot;Building the Web: 
Beyond HTML&quot;, 2018).  For example, login data like usernames and 
passwords gets stored in databases on web servers along with other 
information about the user.  If you type in a valid user name and the 
right password (in other words the pair matches a combination in the 
database), then a server-side script will retrieve the appropriate data 
and use it to customize the web page for you.  Additionally, based on 
our previous coursework on static web pages versus Web 2.0 sites and 
Content Management Systems, we know that more and more websites are 
allowing users to add content to web pages.  Since most users may not 
know HTML, the websites are coded so that a user need only write content 
into a web form, and select &quot;Save&quot;.  &quot;A server-side 
script then saves the content to the database, where it sits in storage 
until someone requests it&quot; (&quot;Building the Web: Beyond HTML&quot;, 
2018).  A perfect example of this is our UoPeople discussion forums.  
To upload my discussion post, I simply write into the text field and hit 
submit.  The server stores my post to a database.  Later, using their 
browser, other students can view my post along with everyone else&apos;s.
</p>

<h2>Is Knowing PHP Enough?</h2>
<p>
It is generally known that web development is broken down into two parts, 
the client-side (front-end) and the server-side (back-end).  It is still 
useful to know how the back-end works even if you are focused on front-end 
development.(&quot;Learn web development&quot;, 2018). In fact, advanced 
front-end developers will often have expertise in both client-side and 
server-side technologies (Shiotsu, Y., 2018), with many programmers 
delivering a complete Software as a Service (SaaS) site, &quot;including a 
dynamic web client, server-side business logic, a scalable database, 
deployment, and operational support&quot; (Yared, November 8, 2014).  A 
full-stack programmer eliminates the need for different developers at different 
tiers of application from needing to communicate to each other, which takes 
time.  A full-stack programmer can add a feature to an application at all 
tiers and speed up feature deployment.  Considering most software startup 
companies are deploying their product on the web rather than on a disk, 
being able to do full-stack development would be increasingly important for 
timely deployment.
</p>

<p>
However, as technology becomes more complex, with more features added to 
websites, hiring full-stack developers with deep skills in all areas may 
can become difficult (likened to finding a unicorn).  Therefore, as 
technology becomes more complex, full stack integrators, who only have a 
surface understanding of all the technologies and how they come together 
may be required, along with programmers with deeper skills in particular 
areas (Yared, November 8, 2014).  Ar a result of complexity, the type of 
programmer that is needed may fluctuate as technology evolves.  At the 
time of this writing, a search of Indeed.com shows that the top need today 
in web programming is the front-end developer (with 24,005 job openings), 
followed by full stack developers  (at 14,305 jobs), and then the back-end 
developer (with 8,069 openings).
