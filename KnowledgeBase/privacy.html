<h1>Protecting Our Online Privacy</h1>
<p>
The internet can be a great tool for learning and 
communication, not to mention fun.  However, we 
have to be careful whenever we use the internet 
because our privacy can be at risk.  As users, we 
need to be aware that governments and private 
companies monitor internet users. The American 
Civil Liberties Union states that social media 
monitoring software (SMMS) &quot;can be used to covertly
 monitor, collect, and analyze our social media 
data from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and 
Instagram&quot; and it can be used to track us 
geographically as we communicate (McCullough, 
May 6, 2016).  
</p>

<h2>Why are users monitored?</h2>
<p>
Governments might monitor users as a way to prevent
terrorism and protect their population from people 
planning criminal activity. Companies might want to 
monitor users to give them a better experience or to 
better market goods and services to them.  For 
example, web browsers may display advertising that 
better fits a user&apos;s recent internet activity.  While
these may be legitimate reasons for monitoring users,
there are risks to society and users when our privacy
is threatened.  The ACLU warns that people are less 
likely to share ideas when they think they are being 
watched, which hurts open discourse (McCullough, May 6,
2016).  Even more alarming is the fact that SMMS can 
also be &quot;aimed at anyone who threatens existing power,
whistleblowers, people who have reported misconduct,
or someone an agent personally dislikes&quot; (McCullough,
May 6, 2016).
</p>

<h2>How can users prevent being monitored?</h2>
<p>Anytime you install a new app, sign up for a new website
and even boot up a new device, the privacy policy that
you read and have to acknowledge usually tells you that
your data will be collected and perhaps how it will be
used (Nield, January 30, 2018). Here are some ways to
limit what is collected:
	<ul>
	<li>Check the security and privacy settings on your devices.</li>
	<li>Turn off cookie tracking in your browser settings.</li>
	<li>Install a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to hide your location and encrypt data.</li>
	<li>Use a TOR browser.</li>  (Nield, January 30, 2018)
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Can user privacy be accomplished online?</h2>
<p>Although there are some steps you can take to limit 
the data that is collected about you, you ultimately 
need to realize that some data will be collected. The 
ACLU suggests that the best way to prevent being monitored 
is to make government policy changes that limit 
surveillance.  Specifically, they want to make government 
agencies use of our data transparent and accountable to 
the public, so that whatever surveillance is done does not 
take away our civil liberties and if the rules are broken 
there would be repercussions (McCullough, May 6, 2016).  
There is no such thing as online privacy, but we can limit 
how much information is tracked.
